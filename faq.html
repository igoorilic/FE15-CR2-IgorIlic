        <h1>Frequently Asked Questoions</h1><br><br>
        <p><b>What is your blog about?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Food blog is a food, travel and lifestyle blog. I write about recipes, restaurant, coffee and brunch.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>Can I use your recipes on my blog or website?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Yes, you can adapt my recipes and share them on your own personal food blogs, but I ask that you credit me
            for the recipe and add a link back to my blog Food blog. If you want to publish one of my recipes for a
            brand campaign or on a publication, please contact me first to request permission.</p><br>
        <p><b>Why did you start a blog?</b>
        </p>
        <p>I created Food blog in 2011 as a place to share my photos and cooking experiments. Over the years, Food blog
            developed into a space to share my favourite recipes, restaurants.</p><br>
        <p><b>How often do you blog?</b></p>
        <p>I blog once or twice a week, a mix of recipes, restaurant reviews and travel guides.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>I commented on one of your recipes and am wondering why it hasn’t been posted.</b></p>
        <p>I make it a point to read every comment left on our blog and do my best to respond in a timely manner, especially to any questions. I love engaging with readers and only approve comments that add value to the recipe page. All comments are filtered for spam and I don’t post anything derogatory or rude. I also do not post comments with links in them.</p><br>
        <p><b>Do you promote brands you like or allow sponsored posts?</b></p>
        <p>Yes, I absolutely do! I am always on the lookout for fabulous new products and ideas to share with our HowToCook.recipes readers. I welcome suggestions but will only consider those I think would be a good fit for our audience. In addition, we don’t provide reviews of the products.</p><br>
        <p><b>What’s the easiest way to get all your recipes?</b></p>
        <p>Just subscribe to my newsletter at the bottom of this page and my recipes will be sent right to your email. New recipes will be sent every week, along with ideas, cooking tips and so much more. Once you’ve signed up for my newsletter, make sure you confirm your email address.</p>
